# D793 - Task 2: Fortran to Python Code Translation

This project is a submission for Task 2 of the Formal Languages Overview course. It involves the translation of a legacy Fortran weather forecasting application into a modern, object-oriented Python application that replicates the original's functionality and console output.

## Description

The original application, written in Fortran, calculates and displays a 7-day weather forecast based on a fixed set of input data. This project provides a complete translation of that logic into a Python script (`weather_app.py`).

## How to Run the Program

1.  Ensure you have a Python 3 interpreter installed.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
3.  Execute the following command:
    ```sh
    python weather_app.py
    ```

## APIs, SDKs, and Libraries Used

This project was written in Python 3 and relies exclusively on the **Python Standard Library**. No external APIs, SDKs, or third-party packages are required for this application to run. The specific standard library module used is:
-   `math` (used implicitly by built-in functions like `sum`, `max`, `min`)
